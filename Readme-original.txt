1. GENERAL INFORMATION
======================

Before you start
----------------

Discovery mod was designed to be easy for beginners, but there are several things that you should know before you start.

- Discovery updater is now integrated with Freelancer.exe file. Do not use DSUpdate.exe to launch the game, use Freelancer.exe instead. For online play, your firewall needs to be configured to allow Freelancer.exe to access serverside updater files.
- Using custom shortcuts, Global Server Workaround and other ways to connect to servers is no longer necessary. All Discovery server addresses are stored in dsupdate.cfg file found in Freelancer\EXE folder. You can easily add new servers to this file.
- FLMM is unable to remove ENB Bloom mod during de-activation if it was enabled. You will have to remove d3d8.dll from the Freelancer/EXE folder manually. By default, ENB option is disabled; please do not enable it if you are not sure what you are doing.
- It is not recommended to install any other mods or patches prior to and after Discovery activation. 1.1 official patch is included into the mod.
- If Discovery won't activate properly in FLMM, your Freelancer installation is most probably corrupt. Reinstall Freelancer, and FLMM, if necessary.
- Open SP is now always enabled, Campaign SP has been removed for compatibility reasons. Attempts to load campaign save files will result in errors.
- Setting up serverside mod options works only if you run the server. If you do not, these options will have no effect; please leave them default.
- Do not forget to transfer internal equipment (ID and scanner) each time when you buy a new ship.
- ID items present in Discovery act as tractor beams. Civilian IDs are available for purchase from every base (500 credits).
- If your large ship gets stuck while undocking from certain space stations, try moving backward and strafing, use thruster, or log off and on again.
- If you are automatically kicked from multiplayer servers, check your ship loadout for equipment that's no longer mountable on this ship.
- Make sure your cruise speed never exceeds 350 (Discovery limit). If it does, reinstall the mod.
- Refer to Readme.txt file if you need help and more information. Read server rules if you play on multiplayer servers. And, last but not least, enjoy the game!

Overview
--------

The development of Discovery 4.85 has taken 1,5 years to complete. Now we, the newly formed Discovery Development Team, present to you the result of our work. The wait is over. After months of online beta testing, Discovery Freelancer 4.85: Reunion is released and available for download.

Year is 817 After Settlement (A.S.), 16 years after the single-player campaign of Freelancer, and one year after Discovery 4.84 took place. A Sirius-wide war is on the brink of engulfing the sector. While Kusari pushes its onslaught against Bretonia deep into the Leeds system, Bretonia attempts to surround Kusari forces in Tau-31. Liberty attacks Rheinland in Bremen and Hudson, and Rheinland has to pull back to defend its own borders. As if this was not enough, in late 817 the Independent Miners Guild encountered a large number unknown ships in the Orkney system. The ships belonged to a rebel group formed within the long-lost House of Gallia, the existence of which remained unknown for centuries. Creation of a path into Gallia adds a new, powerful, player to the scene, and no one can tell what goals the new House will pursue in these troubled times. Rumors arise that the nation of France was betrayed during the Exodus, making historians and politicians of various Houses search deep into archives to find out what truly happened more than 1000 years ago in Sol.

Storyline is just a portion of the progress taking place in Discovery 4.85. As it was with previous Discovery versions, we created the mod as a full-scale expansion pack that adds diverse new content and yet remains balanced for online play, is stable, and is as bug-free as possible. Discovery 4.85 is the first version of the mod that was developed from the start by the Discovery Development Team, a dedicated group of 3D and 2D artists, coders, designers, writers, and testers.

Increased development time and an increased number of developers allowed us to finalize all features we were planning to implement, and make 4.85 the largest ever update for Discovery mod, which now became of the few mods that actually add more to the game than the original has. We introduced 79 brand new ships with new models, with over 30 previously included ships completely re-designed. Accurate hitboxes had been implemented for almost all ships, old and new. More than a hundred new weapon and equipment types have been added, many having custom models of their own, as well as custom weapon projectile and hit effects. Out of eight dozen new systems Discovery has, more than a half received significant updates, and 11 new ones were included, all of them following much higher quality standards than in previous versions.

The mod now has a renewed balance system for weapons, equipment and ships, plus a fully revamped economy system that provides profitable routes for all locations and factions. To add depth to the new economy, 46 new commodity types were introduced, and nearly all commodities (including original ones) received new detailed icons. The role-playing ID system (used on the official server and most other servers running our mod) has received 53 new IDs with clear and detailed descriptions. The new version also contains about 7000 new and rewritten infocard texts for various new and old ships, items, and places.

Some statistics for the mod include:

- 260 player flyable ships in the game total, of which 225 are introduced by Discovery;
- About 110 new player flyable ship models introduced by version 4.85;
- 134 systems in the game total, of which 79 are introduced by Discovery;
- 11 new systems in 4.85, with about 30 systems receiving significant updates in the latest version;
- 448 bases in the game total, of which about 275 are introduced by Discovery;
- 91 factions in the game total, 44 new factions added by Discovery, of which 11 were introduced by version 4.85;
- Over 100 new weapons introduced in 4.85, upping the number of new Discovery weapons above 200;
- 46 new commodities introduced in 4.85, with multiple new trade routes;
- 117 role-playing IDs in Discovery, of which 53 introduced by version 4.85;
- About 10,000 new infocard texts introduced by Discovery, of which about 7,000 added or rewritten for 4.85.

The integrated Discovery automatic updater allows to download and apply new updates easily without having to re-download and re-install the whole package. The updater does not restrict offline play, and you will still be able to play single-player or on a local LAN server without an internet connection.

If you prefer online play, you are welcome to join the official Discovery Freelancer RP 24/7 server and a number of other servers running Discovery. Currently active servers include Discovery USA RP 24/7, Discovery UK RP 24/7, Discovery Server Berlin, Discovery Kansas, Discovery of Discovery, Rise of the Fallen Empires; information about these (and other) servers is listed below in the readme. Server operators are welcome to run Discovery mod without any restrictions, IONCROSS data files are included, and we provide help and support for all servers running the mod. All servers that run our mod are listed in dsupdate.cfg file located in Freelancer\EXE folder to allow quick connect to all of them without using shortcuts or patches. To add another server, you simply need to add its address to dsupdate.cfg.

In January 2007, Discovery mod was chosen to receive the Simulation Genre Award of ModDB.com's Mod of the Year-2006 contest (MOTY-2006).

2. INSTALLATION & UPDATES
=========================

Discovery Installation
----------------------

1) Requirements:

- Complete and clean installation of Freelancer without any patches or addons. English version is preferable, for all Discovery texts are written in English.

- Freelancer Mod Manager (FLMM) version 1.3 (1.31) installation. Do not use any versions of FLMM 1.4 or 1.5. You can get FLMM here: http://igx89.home.comcast.net/FLMM_Downloads.html

- 300 Mb of free space is required on the disk where FLMM is installed; 300 Mb of free space is required on the disk where Freelancer is installed. If Freelancer and FLMM are installed on one disk, 600 Mb of free space is required. No additional system requirements apply.

- Prior to installing Discovery, it is recommended to remove (after backing up) all Freelancer-related files from My Documents\My Games\Freelancer folder.

2) After Freelancer is installed, create a copy of the whole Freelancer folder from C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games (or another location you chose during installation) to any other location. "Copy of Freelancer" next to your main Freelancer folder will be enough.

This is your backup in case any problems with your installation occur. It IS legal to make such backup. In case of trouble, simply remove everything from your main FL folder, and copy contents of "Copy of Freelancer" back there. This way, you get a free installation in less than 5 minutes.

3) When all required software is installed and ready for use, download the Discovery mod (.zip.flmod file) and double-click it. If FLMM was installed correctly, the file will be unzipped to FLMM folder. "Ready for activation" message will appear, and FLMM main window will open.

4) On this stage, you should be ready to set up options for Discovery. If you are not sure what to choose, refer to appropriate section of the Readme.txt file.

5) To activate Discovery in FLMM:

SIMPLY select the mod, and SIMPLY activate it. Nothing else is required on this stage.

Do not install any other patches, mods, "minor additions" etc neither before nor after Discovery. If you do it, nothing described here will work (and you'll eventually be banned for cheating).

Mod options window will appear. Choose the options you prefer and proceed with activation; this will take some time (up to 1 minute).

6) If the mod is activated successfully, you will see a green mark next to its name in FLMM. Everything is ready for playing now.

7) Before de-activation:

Make sure that no FL-related programs are running, and no FL-related files are opened for editing/viewing!

This is the cause of most de-activation errors. If you have Freelancer game .exe files launched, have any Freelancer files open in any editors/viewers, use any FL-related software, the de-activation will not proceed correctly, and you'll end up with corrupt installation.

8) To uninstall Discovery mod:

DO NOT "RESTORE BACKUPS" IN FLMM!

SIMPLY click De-activate.

The procedure of restoring backups is absolutely identical to mod de-activation, IF, and only IF, you had no other mods installed (and that should be the case for Discovery). Basically, FLMM creates backups of all files that the mod is changing. When you press De-activate, FLMM just restores the previously created backups of original files.

To put it simple, when one mod is activated, "Restore backups" and "De-activate" must perform exactly the same operation.

Note that d3d8.dll file will have to be removed manually from Freelancer\EXE folder if you've activated ENB Series mod.

9) If the activation/de-activation results in errors appearing, follow these steps:

- Check your mod download (size of it, at least, and integrity of the archive);
- Make sure FLMM has correct paths to the Freelancer folder;
- Check that your Freelancer installation doesn't contain any FLMM backup files in it, and is generally OK.

If nothing helps:

- De-activate Discovery in FLMM. If you won't de-activate on this stage (or if it's impossible to de-activate), you'll have to re-install FLMM completely.
- Delete all files from your Freelancer folder, and restore them with the backup Freelancer clean installation files.
- Attempt to activate the mod again.

If the latter doesn't work, then either your backup is corrupt, or the mod download is incomplete/corrupt. Note that before uploading each mod release, including betas, is checked, so it's not possible that the mod package itself is corrupt.

Serverside Installation Tips
----------------------------

1) For the serverside installation, everything is the same as for clientside. Server operators should pay special attention to serverside setup options.

2) Ioncross Freelancer Server Operator (IFSO) hash files for Discovery are located in the IONCROSS folder in mod root folder. Using ISFO V or IFSO V.1 is highly recommended. You can get IFSO from here: http://ioncross.com/software

3) To run Discovery with FLHook, copy FLHook files from "bin" to Freelancer\EXE directory and edit the FLHook.ini in order to suite your needs. Then, open dacomsrv.ini in Freelancer\EXE and append FLHook.dll to the [Libraries] section.

4) Player wipe is not essential when the server is transferred to a new Discovery version. To transfer the player database safely, use Freelancer Player Cleaner by Lancer Solurus (http://forums.seriouszone.com/showthread.php?t=51999). "Locked Gates" option MUST be unchecked. You can get the correct version of HashList.txt for FL Cleaner from Discovery website. Remember, creating a backup of the player database is essential before cleaning.

Please consult the Discovery Development Team if you wish to ensure that your player database is transferred to new mod versions safely.

While transition to 4.85, players will NOT have to re-buy any ships. Necessary changes to the ships may be made automatically by serverside tools (if the server has those). Before launch into space players should unmount ALL equipment remount it. That is to prevent ships being equipped with items they are not supposed to carry anymore. All battleships lose their CD mount. The CD slot was turned into a CM slot to allow players to unmount the CD, so, unmount it and do not use it any longer. CM should be kept where it was originally mounted.

5) Option to change starting location serverside had been removed from the mod. You may change the location manually, however, correct functionality of the server in this case is not guaranteed.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1) For most common troubleshooting options, see section 9) of installation instructions.

2) If you have other mods activated in FLMM, they MUST be de-activated prior to Discovery activation.

3) If you used FLMM 1.4 beta (which is NOT recommended under any circumstances), make sure you never activated/deactivated speed mod prior to Discovery. Speed mod in 1.4 is not deactivated properly, which might lead to increased speed in multiplayer and, as a result, ban from servers.

Remember that cruise speed cannot be more than 350 in Discovery. If you are going faster, you will be banned for cheating. Also note that speed more than 350 may still be displayed as 350 on your HUD; compare speed of your ship to other ships to be sure.

4) If the steps listed here do not help, visit our forums at http://discoverygc.com/forums and report your problem there.

Setup Options
-------------

1. Clientside Options

Clientside options work both for multiplayer and single-player. If you run a server, changing these options will not have any effect on players.

- Would you like the intro movies on/off? - Off is default.
- What view distance would you prefer? - This setting changes view distance for space stations, jump gates, trade lanes, and other objects. NPC or player ships are not affected. Medium is Discovery default; Low is Freelancer original values; High is for the longest view distance, but might cause low FPS even on hi-end PCs in certain systems.
- Would you like to enable spinning planets? - Spinning planets may not work properly on certain PC configurations. Planets often slow down and stop if you fly far away or just use Alt-Tab to switch windows.
- Would you like player engine trails enabled? - No is default. Player engine trails don't cause graphic issues or slowdowns on most systems.
- Would you like ENBSeries effect mod enabled? - No is default. Yes will enable ENB Series bloom mod that adds advanced video effects like bloom to Freelancer. In this case FPS drops significantly; for many systems, especially portable, compatibility issues had been reported. DO NOT enable it unless you know what you are doing.

2. Serverside Options

These options are server-related and should not be changed by players unless necessary. Starting money and reputation options work for server administrators only. Uniform choice will affect single-player game.

- Set amount of starting money for new server characters - 8,500 is default, server administrators may change this value, ranging from 2,000 to 1,850,000,000.
- Select reputation for new server characters - No is default and is recommended for role-play servers. Yes sets all factions to be neutral to beginning players, except for certain overall hostile factions.
- Select starting location for new server characters - Planet Erie in Pennsylvania is the new default starting location for Discovery. You have New York and several other starting systems to choose from.
- Select uniforms for new server characters - Trent's uniform is default. Choose carefully, for uniform applies to all new characters created on server. This option also works for single-player.

3. Open Single-Player Options

From version 4.85, Discovery does not support campaign single-player mode due to compatibility issues. Open SP is now enabled by default.
Clientside options will affect Open SP. Serverside options will not, except for player uniform option.

- Which system would you like to start in? - There are 57 systems to choose from, including several new Discovery systems.
- How much starting money would you like? - Choose amount of starting credits, ranging from 2,000 to 1,850,000,000.
- What reputation do you want? - Default Discovery reputation is the lawful role-play reputation used in multiplayer. Other options are: All factions neutral, friendly or hostile. Certain factions are hostile regardless of your choice.

Mod Updates
-----------

Updating is performed by the Discovery automatic updater developed by Cannon. Each time the game is launched, it checks with the server if new updates are available. Updates are cumulative (you don't have to download all of them, just the latest one). If automatic update fails, you can download standalone update packages from our forums (http://discoverygc.com) from elsewhere. Please follow the instructions included with the update to ensure that your installation is correct.

Automatic updating is highly recommended. Use manual updating only if automatic updater fails, and please report all such issues on our forums.

When the updater detects presence of the new update, it closes Freelancer and downloads the update. Later, Freelancer is launched again.

Refer to DSUpdateReadme.txt document included with the mod for additional information on the updater.

Note that Discovery updates will not follow the same version numbering as previous versions. Due to limited number of available version numbers, we cannot continue after "4.85" for the update. So, it is likely that the updates will be numbered as 13.01, 13.02 etc. This numbering is used because 4.85 is actually the 13th version of Discovery (first public release had version number 4.72).

For testing and fixing:

- Gallic freighters spawning without escort.

Player wipe is not required when transferring from 4.82 to 4.83. Wipe is essential if the server previously had Discovery 4.80 or earlier installed, and highly recommended if the server had 4.81 or 4.82 installed.
Using Freelancer Player Cleaner by Lancer Solurus (http://forums.seriouszone.com/showthread.php?t=51999) is recommended to transfer the player database between the mod versions ("Locked Gates" option MUST be unchecked). You can get the correct version of HashList.txt for FL Cleaner from Discovery website. Remember, creating a backup of the player database is essential before cleaning.

-= End of changelog =-

-= Server Transitions =-

Transition to 4.83 from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

Clientside:
Equipment changes necessary after this release:
- Albatross & Assault Battlecruisers: equipping battleship shields is no longer possible.
- Corsair Dreadnought is no longer usable and should be exchanged for another ship.
- Corsair Gunboat - forward gun should be replaced with a turret.
- Liner and Prison Liner - most level 8 turrets should be changed to level 7 or lower.
- Miner - level 8 turrets should be changed to level 7 or lower.
- Mk II light fighters - level 9 shields should be changed to level 8 or lower.
- Starblazer - weapons and shield should be changed.
- Swarm missile pod is no longer usable, should be unequipped and sold.

Serverside:
Player wipe is not required when transferring from 4.82 to 4.83. Wipe is essential if the server previously had Discovery 4.80 installed, and highly recommended if the server had 4.81 installed.
Using Freelancer Player Cleaner by Lancer Solurus (http://forums.seriouszone.com/showthread.php?t=51999) is recommended to transfer the player database between the mod versions ("Locked Gates" option MUST be unchecked). You can get the correct version of HashList for FL Cleaner from Discovery forums. Remember, backup of player database is essential before cleaning.

Transition to 4.82 from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

Player wipe is not required when transferring from 4.81 to 4.82. However, wipe is essential if the server previously had Discovery 4.80 installed.
Most of the empty systems added in previous release were removed. This was done to improve performance, and to make exploration of new Sirius regions less repetitive.
52 of those new systems still remain, including 29 clan systems. Many of them were renamed and relocated, see the navigation map for details (discoverymap.gif).
Characters, multiplayer and single-player, that stay in empty systems with no objects (clan systems are safe) should be moved away to populated systems, either by using Ioncross editors or by travelling in-game. Attempt to log in with a character from deleted system will cause both client and server to crash. Therefore, players who enter the server and see '????' symbols instead of system name near their characters should never attempt to log in, but rather contact administrator and request their characters to be moved.
Level of transport turret slots was lowered, so transport owners might get kicked for cheating. To fix this, players should unequip and sell turrets that can no longer be mountable on transports (gunboat turrets).

Transition to 4.81 from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

Because of extensive balance changes, player wipe is highly recommended when transferring to 4.81. If server administrators are unable to perform wipe for some reason, there are compatibility features that will allow to transfer without wipe. However, if you do so, lag and number of flserver errors will increase drastically, and wipe will still be essential when moving on to future versions.

Transition to 4.80 from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

Do not forget to transfer your faction ID whenever you buy a new ship. Faction ID item also serves as a tractor beam. More information about ID system is available from Discovery forums.

Transition to 4.79 from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

Player wipe is not necessary for 4.79, but players who own following ships must re-buy them:
- Huegenot
- Marsflyer
- Slipstream
Marsflyer weapons and equipment from previous versions might also cause problems, both serverside and clientside.
If problems occur while undocking from stations or planets, unequip all items from your ship and equip them once more.

Transition to 4.78 from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

Don't forget to transfer and mount your scanner and tractor each time you buy a new ship. Scanners and tractors (as well as armor) are equipped in Internal Equipment section of ship inventory, like nanobots and shield batteries.
In 4.78, all original Freelancer ships got new versions with the same stats, to make player looting option possible to implement. Therefore, original game ship hulls cost nothing now, and when you'll try to sell your old ship for a new one, you won't get part of the price of your ship back, like before. This issue only concerns original ships (from Starflier to Titan).
Players who bought capital ships before 4.78 will not notice much difference in their hull integrity after equipping a new armor upgrade, because in 4.77 and before all capital ships came with hidden armor preinstalled. However, now there's no preinstalled armor for new ships you buy, and using upgrades will help a lot.
